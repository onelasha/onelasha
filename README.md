# 👋 Hi, I’m Lavrenti DeLavrenti

**Director of Engineering / Application Development** with a strong track record of building and scaling distributed, high-performing teams and modern cloud-native platforms. I specialize in aligning engineering execution with business outcomes, product strategy, and customer impact.

## 🔧 What I do
- Lead and scale multi-team engineering organizations (onshore + offshore)
- Drive delivery of large-scale SaaS platforms used by tens of thousands of users
- Modernize legacy systems into cloud-native, event-driven architectures
- Establish engineering excellence through DORA metrics, CI/CD, observability, and DevOps culture
- Partner closely with Product, Architecture, Security, and GTM leadership

## ☁️ Technical leadership areas
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Azure (Cloud Run, Fargate, Pub/Sub, EventBridge, Web PubSub)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), Node.js (NestJS), event-driven & eventual consistency
- **Frontend & Mobile:** Angular, Ionic (Android & iOS)
- **Data & AI:** RAG architectures, vector search, LLM integrations (LangChain, Gemini, OpenAI)
- **DevOps:** Terraform/Terragrunt, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, trunk-based development
- **Quality & Scale:** Feature flags, release governance, shared QA/DevOps models

## 🚀 Current focus
- Scaling engineering organizations and platforms with measurable business impact
- AI-native product and platform development
- Executive-level engineering leadership (Director / VP roles)
- Building practical, production-ready AI systems (RAG, automation, analytics)

## 🧱 Nedlia — SaaS Engineering Reference Platform

[Nedlia](https://github.com/onelasha/Nedlia) is my **reference implementation and standards baseline** for building complex, production-grade SaaS platforms.

It reflects how I design, document, and govern modern systems in real organizations — not demos or toy examples.

**Nedlia focuses on:**
- Clean REST API design and contract-first development
- Consistent response and error-handling standards
- Cloud-native, event-driven architecture patterns
- Scalable service boundaries and ownership models
- Operational excellence (observability, resilience, CI/CD)
- Security, versioning, and backward compatibility by design
- Documentation as a first-class engineering artifact

This repository acts as my **go-to blueprint** for:
- Designing new SaaS platforms
- Modernizing legacy systems
- Establishing org-wide engineering standards
- Aligning architecture decisions with business outcomes

It evolves alongside real-world leadership experience and is intentionally opinionated, pragmatic, and production-focused.


## 📈 Engineering philosophy
> Build systems and teams that scale **together**.  
> Optimize for outcomes, not activity.  
> Make complexity explicit, then remove it.
