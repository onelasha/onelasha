## 🔧 What I do
- Lead and scale multi-team engineering organizations (onshore + offshore)
- Deliver large-scale SaaS platforms serving tens of thousands of users
- Modernize legacy systems into cloud-native, event-driven architectures
- Establish engineering excellence through DORA metrics, CI/CD, observability, and DevOps culture
- Partner closely with Product, Architecture, Security, and GTM leadership

---

## ☁️ Technical leadership areas
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Azure (Cloud Run, Fargate, Pub/Sub, EventBridge, Web PubSub)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), Node.js (NestJS), event-driven & eventual consistency
- **Frontend & Mobile:** Angular, Ionic (Android & iOS)
- **Data & AI:** RAG architectures, vector search, LLM integrations (LangChain, Gemini, OpenAI)
- **DevOps:** Terraform/Terragrunt, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, trunk-based development
- **Quality & Scale:** Feature flags, release governance, shared QA/DevOps models

## 🧱 Nedlia — SaaS Engineering Reference Platform
[Nedlia](https://github.com/onelasha/Nedlia) is my **reference platform and standards baseline** for building complex, production-grade SaaS systems.

It represents how I design, document, and govern real-world platforms — not demos or toy examples.

**What Nedlia codifies:**
- REST API design and contract-first development
- Standardized response and error-handling patterns
- Cloud-native, event-driven architecture
- Clear service boundaries and ownership models
- Operational excellence (CI/CD, observability, resilience)
- Security, versioning, and backward compatibility by design
- Documentation as a first-class engineering artifact

I use Nedlia as my **go-to blueprint** for:
- Designing new SaaS platforms
- Modernizing legacy systems
- Establishing org-wide engineering standards
- Aligning architecture decisions with business outcomes

## 📈 Engineering philosophy
> Build systems and teams that scale **together**  
> Optimize for outcomes, not activity  
> Make complexity explicit — then remove it
